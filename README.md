## How to get started
Start mongod.

-1.  Create new folder called "db" in the same path as the Server and Client folders.

-2. ADD C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin(Assuming you have the default path of MongoDB) to the Path of system Environmental Variables.

Run: 

`mongod --dbpath="(your path)" `


on your first terminal(may need more than 1) run:

`mongod --dbpath="db"`

if system enviornment not setup, run :

 `"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="(your path)"`
